How could we achieve multitasking in a system with no OS, and thus no threads. There are two main approaches to multitasking: preemptive multitasking and cooperative multitasking. In preemptive multitasking a task that's currently being executed can, at any point in time, be preempted (interrupted) by another task. On preemption, the first task will be suspended and the processor will instead execute the second task. At some point the first task will be resumed. Microcontrollers provide hardware support for preemption in the form of interrupts . In cooperative multitasking a task that's being executed will run until it reaches a suspension point . When the processor reaches that suspension point it will stop executing the current task and instead go and execute a different task. At some point the first task will be resumed. The main difference between these two approaches to multitasking is that in cooperative multitasking yields execution control at known suspension points instead of being forcefully preempted at any point of its execution.","breadcrumbs":"Multitasking","id":"appendix/explore.html#multitasking","title":"Multitasking"},"appendix/explore.html#other-communication-protocols":{"body":"SPI, I2S, SMBUS, CAN, IrDA, Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth, etc. Different applications use different communication protocols. User facing applications usually have an USB connector because USB is an ubiquitous protocol in PCs and smartphones. Whereas inside cars you'll find plenty of CAN \"buses\". Some digital sensors use SPI, others use I2C and others, SMBUS. So where to next? There are several options: You could check out the examples in the microbit board support crate repository. All those examples work for the micro:bit board you have. You could try out this motion sensors demo . Details about the implementation and source code are available in this blog post . You could check out Real Time for The Masses . A very efficient preemptive multitasking framework that supports task prioritization and dead lock free execution. You could try running Rust on a different development board. The easiest way to get started is to use the cortex-m-quickstart Cargo project template. You could check out this blog post which describes how Rust type system can prevent bugs in I/O configuration. You could check out my blog for miscellaneous topics about embedded development with Rust. You could check out the embedded-hal project which aims to build abstractions (traits) for all the embedded I/O functionality commonly found on microcontrollers. You could join the Weekly driver initiative and help us write generic drivers on top of the embedded-hal traits and that work for all sorts of platforms (ARM Cortex-M, AVR, MSP430, RISCV, etc.)","breadcrumbs":"Other communication protocols","id":"appendix/explore.html#other-communication-protocols","title":"Other communication protocols"},"appendix/explore.html#pulse-width-modulation-pwm":{"body":"In a nutshell, PWM is turning on something and then turning it off periodically while keeping some proportion (\"duty cycle\") between the \"on time\" and the \"off time\". When used on a LED with a sufficiently high frequency, this can be used to dim the LED. A low duty cycle, say 10% on time and 90% off time, will make the LED very dim wheres a high duty cycle, say 90% on time and 10% off time, will make the LED much brighter (almost as if it were fully powered). In general, PWM can be used to control how much power is given to some electric device. With proper (power) electronics between a microcontroller and an electrical motor, PWM can be used to control how much power is given to the motor thus it can be used to control its torque and speed. Then you can add an angular position sensor and you got yourself a closed loop controller that can control the position of the motor at different loads.","breadcrumbs":"Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)","id":"appendix/explore.html#pulse-width-modulation-pwm","title":"Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)"},"appendix/explore.html#real-time-clock-rtc":{"body":"This peripheral can be used to track time in \"human format\".

A microcontroller is much cheaper than a general purpose computer. Not only the microcontroller is cheaper; it also requires much less external electrical components to operate. This makes Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) smaller and cheaper to design and manufacture. Another big reason is power consumption. A microcontroller consumes orders of magnitude less power than a full blown processor. If your application will run on batteries that makes a huge difference. And last but not least: (hard) real time constraints. Some processes require their controllers to respond to some events within some time interval (e.g. a quadcopter/drone hit by a wind gust). If this deadline is not met, the process could end in catastrophic failure (e.g. the drone crashes to the ground). A general purpose computer running a general purpose OS has many services running in the background. This makes it hard to guarantee execution of a program within tight time constraints.","breadcrumbs":"When should I use a microcontroller?","id":"background/index.html#when-should-i-use-a-microcontroller","title":"When should I use a microcontroller?"},"background/index.html#why-should-i-not-use-rust":{"body":"Or why should I prefer C over Rust?

Once flashed, the microcontroller will execute the flashed program every time it is powered on. In this case, our rustled program will be the only program in the microcontroller memory. By this I mean that there's nothing else running on the microcontroller: no OS, no daemon, nothing. rustled has full control over the device. This is what is meant by bare-metal programming. OS operating system Daemon program running in the background Connect the micro:bit to your computer and run the following commands on a new terminal. We need to give OCD the name of the interfaces we are using: $ # All\n$ # Windows: remember that you need an extra `-s %PATH_TO_OPENOCD%\\share\\scripts`\n$ openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/nrf51.cfg The program will block; leave that terminal open. Now it's a good time to explain what this command is actually doing. I mentioned that the micro:bit actually has two microcontrollers. One of them is used as a USB interface and programmer/debugger. This microcontroller is connected to the target microcontroller using a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface (this interface is an ARM standard so you'll run into it when dealing with other Cortex-M based microcontrollers). This SWD interface can be used to flash and debug a microcontroller. It uses the CMSIS-DAP protocol for host debugging of application programs. It will appear as a USB device when you connect the micro:bit to your laptop. As for OpenOCD, it's software that provides some services like a GDB server on top of USB devices that expose a debugging protocol like SWD or JTAG. GDB: The G NU d e b ugger will allow us to debug our software by controlling the execution of our program. We will learn more about this a little bit later. Onto the actual command: those .cfg files we are using instruct OpenOCD to look for a CMSIS-DAP USB interface device ( interface/cmsis-dap.cfg ) a nRF51XXX microcontroller target ( target/nrf51.cfg ) to be connected to the USB interface. The OpenOCD output looks like this: Open On-Chip Debugger 0.10.0\nLicensed under GNU GPL v2\nFor bug reports, read http://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html\nInfo : auto-selecting first available session transport \"swd\".

After the load command, our program is stopped at its entry point . This is indicated by the \"Start address 0x8000XXX\" part of GDB's output. The entry point is the part of a program that a processor / CPU will execute first. The starter project I've provided to you has some extra code that runs before the main function. At this time, we are not interested in that \"pre-main\" part so let's skip right to the beginning of the main function. We'll do that using a breakpoint: (gdb) break rustled::main\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x8000218: file src/main.rs, line 8. (gdb) continue\nContinuing.\nNote: automatically using hardware breakpoints for read-only addresses. Breakpoint 1, rustled::main () at src/rustled/src/main.rs:13\n13 let x = 42; Breakpoints can be used to stop the normal flow of a program. The continue command will let the program run freely until it reaches a breakpoint. In this case, until it reaches the main function because there's a breakpoint there. Note that GDB output says \"Breakpoint 1\". Remember that our processor can only use four of these breakpoints so it's a good idea to pay attention to these messages. For a nicer debugging experience, we'll be using GDB's Text User Interface (TUI). To enter into that mode, on the GDB shell enter the following command: (gdb) layout src NOTE Apologies Windows users. The GDB shipped with the GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain doesn't support this TUI mode :( . At any point you can leave the TUI mode using the following command: (gdb) tui disable OK. We are now at the beginning of main . We can advance the program statement by statement using the step command. So let's use that twice to reach the y = x statement. Once you've typed step once you can just hit enter to run it again. (gdb) step\n14 _y = x; If you are not using the TUI mode, on each step call GDB will print back the current statement along with its line number. We are now \"on\" the y = x statement; that statement hasn't been executed yet. This means that x is initialized but y is not. Let's inspect those stack/local variables using the print command: (gdb) print x\n$1 = 42 (gdb) print &x\n$2 = (i32 *) 0x10001fdc (gdb) print _y\n$3 = 134219052 (gdb) print &_y\n$4 = (i32 *) 0x10001fd8 As expected, x contains the value 42 . _y however, contains the value 134219052 (?). Because _y has not been initialized yet, it contains some garbage value. The command print &x prints the address of the variable x . The interesting bit here is that GDB output shows the type of the reference: i32* , a pointer to an i32 value. Another interesting thing is that the addresses of x and _y are very close to each other: their addresses are just 4 bytes apart. Instead of printing the local variables one by one, you can also use the info locals command: (gdb) info locals\nx = 42\n_y = 134219052 OK. With another step , we'll be on top of the loop {} statement: (gdb) step\n17 loop {} And _y should now be initialized. (gdb) print _y\n$5 = 42 If we use step again on top of the loop {} statement, we'll get stuck because the program will never pass that statement. Instead, we'll switch to the disassemble view with the layout asm command and advance one instruction at a time using stepi . NOTE If you used the step command by mistake and GDB got stuck, you can get unstuck by hitting Ctrl+C . (gdb) layout asm If you are not using the TUI mode, you can use the disassemble /m command to disassemble the program around the line you are currently at. (gdb) disassemble /m\nDump of assembler code for function led_roulette::main:\n11 fn main() -> ! { 0x08000188 <+0>: sub sp, #8 12 let _y;\n13 let x = 42; 0x0800018a <+2>: movs r0, #42 ; 0x2a 0x0800018c <+4>: str r0, [sp, #4] 14 _y = x; 0x0800018e <+6>: ldr r0, [sp, #4] 0x08000190 <+8>: str r0, [sp, #0] 15\n16 // infinite loop; just so we don't leave this stack frame\n17 loop {}\n=> 0x08000192 <+10>: b.n 0x8000194 <led_roulette::main+12> 0x08000194 <+12>: b.n 0x8000194 <led_roulette::main+12> End of assembler dump. See the fat arrow => on the left side? It shows the instruction the processor will execute next. If not inside the TUI mode on each stepi command GDB will print the statement, the line number and the address of the instruction the processor will execute next. (gdb) stepi\n0x08000194 17 loop {} (gdb) stepi\n0x08000194 17 loop {} One last trick before we move to something more interesting. Enter the following commands into GDB: (gdb) monitor reset halt\nUnable to match requested speed 1000 kHz, using 950 kHz\nUnable to match requested speed 1000 kHz, using 950 kHz\nadapter speed: 950 kHz\ntarget halted due to debug-request, current mode: Thread\nxPSR: 0x01000000 pc: 0x08000188 msp: 0x10002000 (gdb) continue\nContinuing. Breakpoint 1, led_roulette::main () at src/main.rs:8\n8 let x = 42; We are now back at the beginning of main ! monitor reset halt will reset the microcontroller and stop it right at the program entry point. The following continue command will let the program run freely until it reaches the main function that has a breakpoint on it. This combo is handy when you, by mistake, skipped over a part of the program that you were interested in inspecting. You can easily roll back the state of your program back to its very beginning. The fine print : This reset command doesn't clear or touch RAM. That memory will retain its values from the previous run. That shouldn't be a problem though, unless your program behavior depends of the value of uninitialized variables, but that's the definition of undefined behavior (UB). We are done with this debug session. You can end it with the quit command. (gdb) quit\nA debugging session is active. Inferior 1 [Remote target] will be detached. Quit anyway? (y or n) y\nDetaching from program: $PWD/target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette, Remote target\nEnding remote debugging. NOTE If the default GDB CLI is not to your liking check out gdb-dashboard . It uses Python to turn the default GDB CLI into a dashboard that shows registers, the source view, the assembly view and other things. Don't close OpenOCD though! We'll use it again and again later on.

On the first sheet you should find a diagram with a grid of numbered LEDs. If you do not know much about electronics: Each row and column (labelled ROW and COL) represent a GPIO output pin. The components labelled LED are light emitting diodes. LEDs only let current flow one way, and only emit light when current is flowing. If a row is set high, high voltage, and a column is set low, low voltage, the LED at the point that they cross will have a potential difference across it; current will flow and it will light up. The 5x5 array of LEDs are actually wired up as a 3x9 array (3 rows by 9 columns), with 2 missing. This is usually done to make the circuit design easier. The fifth sheet shows how each row and column correspond to each GPIO pin.
